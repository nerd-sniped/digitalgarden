## Welcome! 

Welcome to the beginning of My Digital Garden

This is a series of random and sparce notes, intended for no particular audience but inspired by the concept of [[000_Digital Garden Notes/Rubber Ducking\|Rubber Ducking]] A problem. The idea being, even if I am explaining something to no one in particular, it can help make insight and deeper understanding more accessible.  If you find yourself here, and find any of these notes of any help at all, please don't hesitate to reach out and say as such.  This is a VERY lightly filtered version of what I'm thinking about, and harkens back to the old and weird internet where the interfaces were something you had to figure out and up to the proclivities of the individual coding the website. 

Part of the concept is to learn in the open, or work with the garage door open.  I offer courses and classes,  which I charge money for. If you're patient and kind you can likely find the same information here, much less curated, and likely a lot more difficult to follow, the intersection of commerce and creation are tumultuous at best.  

Now I would like to test the integration with ExcaliDraw  with thie file [[000_Digital Garden Notes/Test File\|Test File]]
