# The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman - Core Takeaways

### 1. **"Empathize with Users"**
   - **Action**: Understand the user's mental model—how they expect things to work based on past experience.
   - **Why**: Design should align with users’ intuitive expectations, minimizing errors and frustrations.
   - **Quick Tip**: Observe real users interacting with your design to uncover unexpected pain points.

### 2. **"Prioritize Discoverability and Feedback"**
   - **Action**: Ensure that users can easily understand available actions (discoverability) and see the effects of their actions (feedback).
   - **Why**: Users feel more confident when they understand both what they can do and what happens as a result.
   - **Quick Tip**: Make critical actions visible and provide immediate feedback—like a button lighting up when pressed.

### 3. **"Leverage Affordances and Signifiers"**
   - **Action**: Use affordances (what an object allows) and signifiers (cues for how to interact) in your designs.
   - **Why**: Clear affordances and signifiers guide users intuitively toward the intended actions.
   - **Quick Tip**: For example, a door with a flat plate signals “push,” while a handle signals “pull.”

### 4. **"Embrace Constraints to Guide Action"**
   - **Action**: Apply physical, logical, cultural, and semantic constraints to reduce errors and guide user behavior.
   - **Why**: Constraints help prevent mistakes by limiting available actions, steering users in the right direction.
   - **Quick Tip**: Use physical barriers or logical cues to make misuse impossible or highly unlikely.

### 5. **"Design for Error"**
   - **Action**: Anticipate common errors and build in ways for users to recover from mistakes.
   - **Why**: Users will inevitably make mistakes, and designing for error improves usability and user satisfaction.
   - **Quick Tip**: Incorporate “undo” options or confirmation steps to reduce the impact of accidental actions.

### 6. **"Human-Centered Design is Key"**
   - **Action**: Start with the user's needs, test frequently, and iterate based on real user feedback.
   - **Why**: Human-centered design creates products that are not only functional but also enjoyable and easy to use.
   - **Quick Tip**: Follow an iterative process—observe, ideate, prototype, and test—to refine the design continually.

These principles help create intuitive, user-friendly products by addressing real user behaviors and expectations. By integrating these into your design process, you reduce friction, anticipate user needs, and foster a more satisfying interaction experience.
