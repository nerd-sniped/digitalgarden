Break Incoming items down into actionable sub tasks and work on those.
Richard Feynman had a concept of 12 projects, in which people tend to have a finite (12) number of ongoing projects in their head, As new information came in it could be categorized based on its relevance to this filter.  If it’s not part of a project, or area of interest, it often can be discarded.  
**PARA** is one of the Acronyms commonly used.

#### Projects
Items that are highly actionable and relevant to an project that is currently being worked on.  
#### Areas
Sections of life that are continually of interest, this will change over time but generally people circle the same tasks or at least wander in a progression from one area to another.  Examples of this are Relationships, Finances, Work, Education, Goals, Hobbies.
#### Resources
These aren’t necessarily actionable but are obviously something worth jotting down. This is something larger like a textbook or larger resource, often these are things that aren’t quite ready to be pulled directly into the Projects or Areas tags but will be in the future
#### Archive
These are completed items or things that realistically won’t need to be referenced, they’re always there but the knowledge has been extracted/used

A tool to parse info and add to the PKM is a pyramid approach to note taking.  A first pass of notes often cast a wide net and collects lots of information. A second pass narrows down to the large concepts or concepts that haven’t fully clicked yet. And a final pass summarizes the entire work in an “executive” summery.  This could take the form of an obsidian document in which each pass is done one on top of the other. I.E.  First pass is at the bottom, Second pass sits above that separated by lines, and finally the executive summary is at the top along with the source, relevant tags, and the summary.  This allows quick access to the core concepts with close proximity to the rest of it. 

Before the start of  every project a startup procedure and finishing procedure should be outlined, this can (and probably should) take a very small amount of time to implement, this can help with stopping and restarting tasks.
Implementing some form of Status Tag or something similar can help capture the in-between concepts that are hard to articulate in the middle of a project.
