1. **Specialize**: Enns argues that by specializing, agencies can better define their expertise and attract ideal clients. Specialization allows a firm to develop deeper knowledge in a specific area, differentiate itself from competitors, and command higher fees. It's about choosing a niche market or service and becoming the authority in that space.
    
2. **Replace Presentations with Conversations**: The manifesto suggests shifting from one-way presentations to two-way conversations. This approach involves actively listening to clients, understanding their challenges, and engaging in a dialogue that positions the firm as a collaborative partner rather than just a service provider.
    
3. **Diagnose Before Prescribing**: Similar to a medical doctor, Enns advises agencies to thoroughly diagnose a client's problems before proposing solutions. This means asking probing questions, understanding the underlying issues, and then crafting a tailored approach that addresses the client’s specific needs.
    
4. **Price on Value, Not Time**: The book encourages agencies to move away from hourly or day rates and instead price their services based on the value delivered to the client. This involves understanding the client's objectives and the impact the agency's work will have on achieving those objectives.
    
5. **Refuse to Work for Free**: Enns strongly opposes the practice of doing speculative work for free in the hopes of winning a client. He argues that this devalues the agency's work and expertise, and suggests that agencies should be compensated for their creative ideas and strategic insights.
    
6. **Reject the RFP Process**: Enns criticizes the Request for Proposal (RFP) process as being inefficient and often unfair. He advises agencies to avoid RFPs that treat them as interchangeable vendors and to seek clients who are willing to engage in a more collaborative and respectful selection process.
    
7. **Improve Expert Positioning Through Education**: The manifesto recommends establishing authority in the industry through education. This could be through writing articles, giving talks, hosting webinars, or any activity that demonstrates the agency's knowledge and thought leadership.
    
8. **Saying No to Wrong Fit Clients**: Enns emphasizes the importance of working with the right clients. This means turning down work that doesn't align with the agency’s expertise or values, and focusing on clients who respect and value the agency's contributions.
    
9. **Get Better Clients, Not More Clients**: The focus here is on quality over quantity. Enns suggests that it's more beneficial to have fewer clients who are a good fit and willing to pay for value, rather than a larger number of less suitable clients.
    
10. **Do Not Base Fees on Client Budgets**: The manifesto advises against setting fees based on what the client is willing to pay. Instead, Enns suggests that fees should be based on the value the agency provides, which may be unrelated to the client’s budget.
    
11. **Keep Selling During Engagements**: Enns recommends continuous engagement with clients throughout the project. This involves regularly demonstrating value, discussing future needs, and showing how the agency can continue to help the client achieve their goals.
    
12. **Focus on Leadership Over Management**: Finally, Enns argues for a shift from managing projects to leading clients. This means guiding clients with strategic advice and visionary thinking, rather than just executing tasks.
