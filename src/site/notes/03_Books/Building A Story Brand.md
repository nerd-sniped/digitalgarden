# Building a Story Brand by Donald Miller - Core Takeaways

### 1. **"Customer as the Hero"**
   - **Action**: Always position your customer, not your brand, as the hero of the story.
   - **Why**: Customers need to see themselves succeeding with your help, not watching your brand’s achievements.
   - **Quick Tip**: Shift focus to what your customer wants to achieve, then present yourself as a guide.

### 2. **"Define the Problem (External, Internal, Philosophical)"**
   - **Action**: Clearly identify and address three types of problems:
      - *External*: Tangible issues (e.g., lack of time or resources)
      - *Internal*: Emotional drivers (e.g., desire for confidence or simplicity)
      - *Philosophical*: Values-based problems (e.g., making a positive impact).
   - **Why**: People buy solutions to internal frustrations more than external problems.
   - **Quick Tip**: Personify a relatable villain that symbolizes these problems to strengthen your message.

### 3. **"Be the Guide, Not the Hero"**
   - **Action**: Show empathy and authority to establish trust, making it clear you understand and can solve the customer’s challenges.
   - **Why**: As a trusted guide, your role is to empower the hero (customer) on their journey.
   - **Quick Tip**: Use testimonials, case studies, or relevant experience to highlight your credibility.

### 4. **"Provide a Simple Plan"**
   - **Action**: Outline clear steps the customer needs to take to achieve success. This plan should be easy to understand and act upon.
   - **Why**: Plans help reduce the customer’s fear of failure by showing them a clear path forward.
   - **Quick Tip**: Keep steps actionable and concise. A “3-Step Success Path” format often works well.

### 5. **"Call to Action"**
   - **Action**: Include direct (e.g., “Buy Now”) and transitional (e.g., “Download Free Guide”) calls to action.
   - **Why**: Clear CTAs prevent hesitation and guide customers toward the next steps.
   - **Quick Tip**: Place bold, direct CTAs prominently on your website to drive action immediately.

### 6. **"Highlight Stakes to Avoid Failure"**
   - **Action**: Communicate what’s at risk if customers don’t take action, emphasizing consequences to reinforce urgency.
   - **Why**: People are often more motivated by avoiding losses than achieving gains.
   - **Quick Tip**: Use phrases that highlight the consequences, creating a sense of urgency.

### 7. **"Paint a Picture of Success"**
   - **Action**: Show customers what their life will look like after they achieve their goals with your help.
   - **Why**: Visualizing success makes the journey compelling, reinforcing the benefits of acting now.
   - **Quick Tip**: Use vivid, relatable examples that showcase status, peace of mind, or satisfaction.
