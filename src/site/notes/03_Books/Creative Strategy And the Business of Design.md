[[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs\|Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]] Comes up a lot and serves as a reference frame to base decisions within. This allows us to make deeper connections between a product and the underlying reason for purchasing.  An example from the book is whitening toothpaste, people buy it to improve their confidence,.  
[[Segmentation\|Segmentation]] This is the process of dividing up your target audience in to groups.  This allows you to get more specific when it comes to addressing individual concerns. 
[[Differentiation\|Differentiation]] What makes the product/service/thing your working on different within the market.  If you're working in the commodity space, people will choose based on price. 
[[Features and Benefits\|Features and Benefits]] Features are tangible things the user experiences. Benefits are the reactions to the features. A feature of a faster processor has the benefit of allowing the user to do more in a single day. 
[[Purchase Funnel\|Purchase Funnel]]  These are the stages that a customer goes through on the way to purchasing a product.
[[Marketing Allowable\|Marketing Allowable]] is the amount of money you can spend to acquire a new customer.
