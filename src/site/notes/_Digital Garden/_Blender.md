[Blender](https://Blender.org) is a ridiculously powerful topographical modeling program, capable of complex [[physics simulations\|physics simulations]], [[_Digital Garden/Photo Realistic Renders\|Photo Realistic Renders]] , [[_Digital Garden/Animation\|Animation]], and [[_Digital Garden/Topological\|Topological]] CAD modeling. 

**In short** : Quads are better than Triangles for [[_Digital Garden/Good Surface Topology\|Good Surface Topology]] but take more memory. If you're designing a game, memory is likely something worth optimizing.  Whatever you do, don't use N-Gons. 

## Settings
[[_Digital Garden/Rendering Optimizations\|Rendering Optimizations]] - Reduce your settings until you start to notice, render that and save Oodles of time.
