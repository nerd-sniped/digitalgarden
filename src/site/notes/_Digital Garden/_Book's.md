I read A lot.  Some of it is for learning, some of it is for entertainment.

### Entertainment 

I commute for work and listen to audiobooks at anywhere from 2.0x to 2.5x speed which allows me to get through a lot of text. I primarily listen to fantasy books. I generally don't take notes on books I read for pleasure but am always happy to discuss the plot/characters/authors.  I'll do my best to keep this list up to date.
