Realistically this should be called Adaptive sampling. It's essentially when blender decides to stop rendering certain sections because they are below the noise threshold.  The Na√Øve way to increase quality on a noisy texture but that increases the samples everywhere. Manipulating the noise threshold value allows blender to determine how to handle the render on a per pixel level.
